This package contains the MiniDraw framework.
</p>

<p>
Notes:

<ul>
 <li> This framework is heavily influenced by JHotDraw 5.1, and some
   abstractions are reused directly. The architecture based on
   MVC is identical to that of JHotDraw but many of the default
   implementations (especially Figure subclasses) are removed, and
   several additions have been made to better suit handling graphics
   for board games. 

 </li> JHotDraw is a framework relying mostly on inheritance for reuse
   wherease MiniDraw generally uses a compositional design
   approach.</li>

 <li> No Z-ordering of figures is presently implemented. </li>

 <li> The experimental 'boardgame' package provides even greater
   support for boardgames.
 </li>

</ul>
