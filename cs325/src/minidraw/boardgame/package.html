This package contains an experimental extension to MiniDraw,
<b>BoardGame</b>, whose hotspots are especially geared towards
supporting board games.

<p>
The package adds quite a few frozen spots to MiniDraw which then are
configured by a set of hot spots for the particular board game. In the
contents list, all interfaces are hot spots while concrete classes are
frozen spots.

<p>
  Review the 'breakthrough' example for an example of using BoardGame.
