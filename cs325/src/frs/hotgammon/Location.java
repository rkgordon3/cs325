/**
 * This enum represents an enumeration of board locations (the "points") in the
 * Backgammon board.
 * 
 * Checkers that are born off are stored in Location.B_BEAR_OFF (black checkers)
 * and Location.R_BEAR_OFF (red checkers).
 * 
 * Checkers that are in the bar are either in B_BAR or R_BAR depending on the
 * checker color: Red checkers are stored in R_BAR until they can move onto
 * B1-B6; and Black checkers are stored in B_BAR.
 * 
 * Two convenience methods are provided to calculate distance between two
 * locations; and to find a location given a player color, starting location,
 * and a distance.
 * 
 * Remember that you can iterate through all values using the foreach construct:
 * 
 * for( Location l : Location.values() ) { (process l) }
 *
